JavaScript Fundamentals Assignment

1.What is JavaScript?
JavaScript (JS) is a cross-platform, object-oriented programming language used by developers to make web pages interactive. 
It allows developers to create dynamically updating content, use animations, pop-up menus, clickable buttons, control multimedia, etc.

2.Variables and Types:
(Declare a variable named userAge and assign it a numerical value representing someone's age.
Declare another variable named userName and assign it a string value representing a person's name.
Output both variables using console.log().)
 var userAge = 30;
 var userName = "Sarika";
 console.log()

3.Comments in JavaScript:
(Write a multi-line comment explaining the purpose of a function you create in the next step.)

Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */ . Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
/* multi-line comment in javascript.
    It is multi line comment.  
    It will not be displayed upon 
    execution of this code. 
*/ 
console.log("Multi-line comment in javascript");

4.Operations:
(Create two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them numerical values.
Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on these variables.
Display the results using console.log().)
//subtraction
function sub() {
    let num1= 10;
    let num2 = 20;
    /* let z = num1- num2;
    console.log(z); */

    let z = num1- num2;
    console.log(z);
}
 sub();

//addition
function add() {
    let num1= 10;
    let num2 = 20;
    /* let z = num1+ num2;
    console.log(z); */

    let z = num1+ num2;
    console.log(z);
}
 add();

//multiplication
function mul() {
    let num1= 10;
    let num2 = 20;
    /* let z = num1* num2;
    console.log(z); */

    let z = num1* num2;
    console.log(z);
}
 mul();

//division
function div() {
    let num1= 10;
    let num2 = 20;
    /* let z = num1/ num2;
    console.log(z); */

    let z = num1/ num2;
    console.log(z);
}
 div();

5.Data Types:
(Create variables to represent different data types: string, number, boolean, and an array.
Provide examples and explain each data type.)
let userName = "Harini";
let userAge = 20;
let x = true;
const cars = ["green", "blue", "red"];

6.Functions in JavaScript:

(Write a function named greetUser that takes a name parameter and returns a greeting message.
Call the function with a sample name and display the result using console.log().)

function greetUser(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "! Welcome!";
}

var sName = "John";
var greetMessage = greetUser(sName);

console.log(greetMessage);

7.if Else in JavaScript:
(Create a variable named temperature and assign it a numerical value.
Write an if-else statement to check if the temperature is greater than 30. Output a message accordingly.)

let temperature = 25;

if (temperature > 30) {
  console.log("It's hot outside!");
} else {
  console.log("It's cold outside!.");
}


8.FOR LOOP:
(Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 5 in the console.)
for(let i=1;i<=5;i++)
{
   console.log(i);
}

9.Loose vs Strict Equality:
(Explain the difference between loose equality (==) and strict equality (===) with examples.)

The loose equality operator ‘==’ allows us to compare two or more operands by converting their value to a common type first and then checking for the equality between them.
‘==’ operator: In Javascript, the ‘==’ operator is also known as the loose equality operator which is mainly used to compare two values on both sides and then return true or false.
 This operator checks equality only after converting both the values to a common type
 example:
    console.log(21 == 21);
    console.log(21 == '21');
 output:true
            true
strict equality operator ‘===’ allows us to compare two or more operands by checking the equality between the values as well as their types .
 It returns true only if the values and the type both match with the other operand.
 example:
    console.log('hello world' === 'hello world');
    console.log(true === true);
    console.log(5 === 5);
output:
    true
    true
    true
